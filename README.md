## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Web Development Skills: You should have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the form and handle the logic.

API Access: You'll need access to a phone number lookup API that can provide carrier information based on phone numbers. Some popular options include Twilio Lookup API, NumVerify, or other similar services. Ensure you have an API key or credentials to access the service.

Icons/Logos: Prepare icons or logos for each telecom carrier (MTN, GLO, Airtel, 9mobile, etc.) that you want to display on the form. You can save these images locally or use URLs to hosted images.

## Usage

To Identify the telecoms carrier from a phone number

Scenario
A user is filling a form in your web application and they are required to enter
their phone number into a form field.

Outcome
After typing the phone number into the form field, the UI indicates that it is an
MTN or GLO or Airtel or 9mobile number e.t.c (e.g if its an MTN line, display the
MTN icon/logo somewhere beside the form field)
